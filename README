This is the source code of the Humble bundle release from Mojang.

They did not license it, so my guess is we are free to have this source code here and work on it.

TODO's (in my view):
-Before starting the game, get a menu with what difficulty and level choicer.
-add levels
-add options menu for audio options etc..

todolist from http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1042382-the-unofficial-catacomb-snatch-patch/

How to build
------------

 * Get Gradle (www.gradle.org) Currently using 1.0-minlestone-8
 * gradle build

Your output artifact is in build/libs/Catacomb-Snatch-1.0.0.jar

You can run it the same way you would run catacomb snatch otherwise (java -jar build/libs/Catacomb-Snatch-1.0.0.jar)
Or use gradle run to build it and run it.
